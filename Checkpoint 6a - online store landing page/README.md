# Brief Description of Design Choices

The design of the GJ Online Store landing page was crafted with a focus on usability, visual appeal, and alignment with an engineering tools theme. Key choices include:

- **Color Scheme**: A bold reddish tone (`rgb(193, 67, 44)`) for the navigation and accents (`rgb(196, 74, 50)`) was selected to reflect energy and reliability, paired with white text (`rgb(253, 253, 253)`) for contrast on a dark implied background, enhancing readability and professionalism.
- **Typography**: Fonts like 'Dancing Script' for the logo header add a unique touch, while 'Roboto' and 'Lato' for body text and product descriptions ensure clarity and modernity, supporting a technical audience.
- **Layout**: A Flexbox-based structure was used for flexibility, with a sticky navigation bar for accessibility and a 60% width container for main sections to balance content and whitespace. Product cards were designed with fixed heights (500px) and borders to maintain uniformity, accented with absolute-positioned price circles and buttons for a standout e-commerce feel.
- **Interactivity**: Hover effects (e.g., border transitions, box shadows) were added to enhance user engagement, with a focus on smooth transitions (0.5s) for a polished experience.
- **Responsiveness**: Percentages (e.g., 60% widths) were employed for initial adaptability, with plans to integrate Bootstrap for a robust grid system, ensuring a seamless transition to mobile devices.

These choices aim to create a functional, visually cohesive online store that appeals to engineering enthusiasts while preparing for scalability with Bootstrap.
